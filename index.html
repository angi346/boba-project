    <h1>Game Recommendations</p>
        <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
          <img class="Icon" src="https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DXwvOFxp_F8N9jw4FW8kCD0SWj8ba9YqDmMPphgkoG7qqEET_yV3vxuQcVcWQJkHX18=w240-h480-rw">
            <p>I'd say this game is pretty infamous. But I think the story is excellent, and the music even more so; it's probably one of the best I've heard, actually. The combat system is pretty interesting, and the graphics are great. And it's free. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>It is a gacha game, though, which means it's basically got a gambling aspect to get characters. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't have self-control. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Arknights</h2>
          <img class="Icon" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/Arknights_icon.png">
          <p>Another gacha game. The same warning applies. It's a tower defense game. If you like the strategic aspect of it, you can play with your own restrictions and figure out strategies on your own, or if you're not the biggest fan of the gameplay, you can look up guides that can be easily replicated. The music is excellent, and the worldbuilding is the best I've ever seen. The art is also great. </p>

          <p>They dabble in a lot of different things, from different music styles to even having languages not often seen for dubbing (e.g. regional dialects of Chinese, German, Russian, Italian, and so on) depending on the character. Personally, I like the story more than Genshin, though they do have a bit of an issue with word bloat. </p>

        <h2>Limbus Company</h2>
          <img class="Icon" src="https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1973530/header.jpg?t=1711352565">
          <p>Again, another gacha game. I'd say this is the most free to play friendly, though, since you can grind everything (with the exception of some cosmetics) and it doesn't take as long as other games (in other words, not months). It offers unique combat and excellent worldbuilding and story. </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>I don't think it suffers from the same word bloat as Genshin and Arknights do, and despite having a fairly large starting cast of characters, since you stick with mostly them throughout, they're fairly well characterized. The characters are also based off classic literature, like Homer's Odyssey and Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment". The music is also excellent.</p>
